# MathUtils

GLSL Math port of common functions into javascript for use with Vectors and Number values.

## Why?

Working with GLSL code your not abe to see the resulting values. This way you can perform similar operations and log what those values are without breaking your shader code.

## How to use

simply clone, no npm for the time being, and import the vectorMath.js or any class you need for you project.

### Todo List

- [X] ~~ add vector equialent for certain methods that can operate on them ~~
- [X] ~~ method overloading? ~~
- [x] ~~ allow vector instaniation with no params ~~
- [X] ~~ add other GLSL functions not featured - thanks to [gl_Matrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix/) for slurp and hermite methods, for implementaion ~~
- [] turn into a package
